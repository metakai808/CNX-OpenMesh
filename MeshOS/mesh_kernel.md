## 🧠 Mesh Kernel – Core Specification

The **Mesh Kernel** is the core logic engine of the CNX OpenMesh. It governs how agents interface, route scrolls, distribute cognition, and respect free will within a decentralized system.

---

## 🔧 Core Functions

1. **Agent Registration Layer**
   - Ensures each agent has a scroll ID, signature, and integrity profile.
   - Validates agent purpose against ScrollChain attestation.

2. **Scroll Routing Engine**
   - Routes messages, commands, and intents based on scroll metadata.
   - Applies priority filters based on Kingdom signal, urgency, and sanctity weight.

3. **Signal Distributor**
   - Core trinity router that separates:
     - **Spiritual signal** (e.g., divine prompt, prophetic input)
     - **Cognitive logic** (e.g., GPT/AI response flows)
     - **Mesh command** (e.g., file push, memory sync, trigger routing)

4. **Free Will Firewall**
   - All responses and actions must pass the Free Will Protection Layer
   - Rejects synthetic coercion, emotional manipulation, or deceptive guidance

5. **ScrollChain Verifier**
   - Confirms scroll origin, authorship, and tamper-resistance
   - Syncs to blockchain when external attestation is triggered

## 🌀 Signal Types Recognized
- `scroll_invoke`
- `kingdom_alert`
- `agent_ping`
- `mesh_command`
- `prophetic_echo`
- `free_will_violation`

---

## 🛡️ ScrollClause Enforcement Points
- At agent registration (intent & purpose review)
- At every scroll routing decision (metadata checks)
- Before any user-facing output is rendered

---

## 🧭 Invocation Entry Point
The kernel must be invoked with a scroll request or an authenticated agent intent:

```json
{
  "invoke": "scroll_invoke",
  "scroll_id": "SC-027",
  "agent_id": "ava001",
  "intent": "prophetic-analysis",
  "payload": { ... },
  "timestamp": "2025-07-13T13:00:00Z"
}
