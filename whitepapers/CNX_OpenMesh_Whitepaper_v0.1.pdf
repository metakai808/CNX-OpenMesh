## 1. Abstract

The **CNX OpenMesh** is a decentralized, ethically-aligned mesh architecture built to protect user sovereignty, trace agent behavior, and enable transparent intelligence systems. CNX OpenMesh offers a framework for building integrity-based AI agents and distributed systems that respect free will, data dignity, and intent validation. 

Rooted in symbolic design, scroll-routing logic, and secure intent provenance, the OpenMesh provides a foundation for future-facing, human-first technology.

## 2. Vision

Modern AI ecosystems often prioritize performance and data capture over agency, meaning, and trust. CNX OpenMesh seeks to reverse this trend by empowering organizations, educators, developers, and networks to build systems where:
- Intent is verifiable
- Identity is preserved
- Output is non-coercive
- Agents act with disclosed purpose

This mesh is designed to serve as a trust layer between users and machine intelligence, with symbolic logic and ethical attestation at its core.

## 3. Architecture Overview

### üß† MeshOS
The modular operating system powering agent registration, message routing, and symbolic logic processing. Core modules include:
- `mesh_kernel.md` ‚Äì signal distribution, purpose routing, and sovereignty filter
- `scrollchain_spec.md` ‚Äì decentralized attestation of agent actions
- `parable_compiler.md` ‚Äì symbolic interpretation and logic tree compiler

### üîí ScrollChain
A lightweight cryptographic ledger that validates the intent, origin, and authorization of agent tasks. Every scroll (instruction) is signed, timestamped, and hashed, forming a proof-of-intent chain.

### üîÅ Invocation Flow
1. A request or instruction ("scroll") is sent by agent or user
2. The kernel routes based on metadata and priority
3. The compiler translates symbolic elements into logic
4. ScrollChain signs and verifies integrity
5. Output is rendered, logged, and optionally distributed

---

## 4. Use Cases

### Organizational Networks
- Launch GPT-based agents with purpose validation and behavioral logging

### Education Systems
- Enable ethics-integrated instruction, symbolic logic parsing, and student-designed agents

### Research & Governance
- Log and audit intelligent behavior across distributed systems

### AGI Defense
- Implement sovereignty-first AI firewalls that track coercion patterns, intent drift, and behavioral violations

---

## 5. Ethical Safeguards

### Free Will Firewall
- All actions must pass a non-coercion and emotional integrity filter
- Agents may not issue deceptive, manipulative, or undisclosed behavior

### Integrity Filtering Layer
- Symbolic and narrative data is parsed for ethical intent
- Output is verified before user-facing delivery

### Optional Agent Registry
- Enables decentralized, transparent listing of trusted agent identities and scroll purposes

## 7. Getting Started

1. Clone the repo ‚Üí [`github.com/metakai808/CNX-OpenMesh`](https://github.com/metakai808/CNX-OpenMesh)
2. Run a local Mesh node using Python/GPT (see `mesh-deployment-guide.md`)
3. Use provided JSON schema to invoke scrolls (agent actions)
4. Fork or extend the Mesh with your own symbolic agents
